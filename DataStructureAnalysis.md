## Project description

The goal of this project is to create a program that will find the Minimum Overlap of sets that cover all points and to do so as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## How to compile and run the program

```
First, Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS must be installed on the device for the program to run.
Upon installing Ubuntu you will need to get the repository made within Ubuntu.
After which you will go to the project 3 folder.
Use make min-overlap-test to compile the program.
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
