## Project description

The goal of this project was to use the Apache Server Product to host a server webpage. After which I had to make a presentation on the process and what I learned.

## How to compile and run the program
```
Install Apache24 through the following link: https://www.apachelounge.com/download/
Make sure the index file is in the htdocs folder
In the command prompt, navigate to Apache24/bin and type the following command: httpd
Go to localhost via typing 127.0.0.1 in a browser of your choice
```
## UI Design

As seen in figure 1, the website has a couple images and links to click on. Upon clicking on the "Video Walkthrough of Page and How It Was Made" the website would take you to a youtube video of how the website was made; however, that video has since been taken down. Figure 2-5 showcases what happens when clicking upon specific links such as the Youtube link. The final image animated image is a clickable video thumbnail that will bring you to one of the videos I made upon clicking it.
